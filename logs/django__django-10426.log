Add app_label validation to showmigrations
Description
	
#29469
#29518
#29506
The app label validation was added to some commands as above tickets.
But showmigrations command doesn't contain it.
So I think the validation should be added to showmigrations command.

</issue>

Constraints:
- Provide a minimal, correct unified diff that will pass tests.
- Do NOT modify tests unless strictly required.
- Ensure file paths in the diff match the repository layout.

Return the diff wrapped in <patch>...</patch>.
